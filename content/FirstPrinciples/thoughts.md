# My thoughts

First principles thinking is a powerful tool to help you break down complex problems into their most basic elements. It's a way of thinking that allows you to see the world in a different light and come up with creative solutions to difficult problems.

I learnt this technique from [Arpit Bhayani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arpitbhayani/)'s [youtube video](https://youtu.be/641_goNZGog?si=bgG-dhYlOpNKKCD7) on consistent hashing. I really loved the way First principles gets you in the depth of the problem and helps you to understand the problem from the scratch.
