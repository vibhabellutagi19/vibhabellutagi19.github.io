<!-- `Learn by doing` is the principle I love to follow. I would be listing all the projects that I have created by following this principle. Few of them would be from the [CodeChallenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/).

Hey there, internet wanderers!

Vibhavari Bellutagi, your friendly neighborhood Data Engineer from India, now exploring the other side of world, staying in France. I finally decided to channel my inner nerd and start sharing stuffs on the internet (aka, blogging). I’m a die-hard fan of that `Learn by Doing` mantra, so expect a lot of hands-on in these parts.

Truth be told, I’ve always wanted a blog. I mean, who wouldn’t want to rant and rave in public without anyone rolling their eyes at you, right? I’m totally new to this whole blogging thing, so please go easy on me if it sometimes looks like my cat typed it. Don’t worry though—I’m practicing every day, and soon I’ll be the tech blogger you never knew you needed!

So, here’s how I’ve organized my little digital playground:

1. [Blogs](/blog): Long-form technical deep-dives (buckle up—this is the serious stuff I’ve been tinkering with or recently discovered).
2. [Tech Bytes](/TechBytes/intro): Quick tips and tricks that are guaranteed to make you go, “Wait, that’s how you do it?!”

My goal is to keep churning out content that’s actually useful (and maybe even a little fun). I’m working to make this better every day—like a perpetual software update, minus the annoying restarts.

Thanks a bunch for dropping by! Hope you find something interesting. Feel free to reach out to me, if you have questions or just want to say hi.

Cheers,
Vibhavari Bellutagi
