        description: 'Hundreds of gigabytes of data need to be processed daily to maintain updated customer information. The Digital Integration Hub must collect and transform all customer-associated data while preserving the latest state. The existing process relies on scheduled Spark jobs that run multiple times per day, taking hours to complete. FlinkSQL offers near real-time processing capabilities, maintains computation state, and guarantees exactly-once processing.',
        details: [
            'Rewrote the SQL queries as Flink-compliant queries, significantly reducing query runtime by analyzing and optimizing query plans. This improved processing speed, ensuring data updates reached the end users within a minute.',
            'Built a customized CDC connector for FlinkSQL to enable seamless integration with Infosphere, and managed historical computation states on S3, enabling efficient incremental data loads while overcoming S3â€™s limitations on request rates.',
            'Streamlined intermediate state storage on S3 using optimized savepoints and checkpoints, resolving "500 slow down" errors and reducing cloud costs by approximately 30%, and achieving a 75-80% decrease in update times for customer profiles.'

        details: [
            'Designed and implemented a solution to anonymize the data on the fly by deploying Spark jobs on a Livy server, allowing users to submit queries using a REST API.',

        description: 'Managed the deployment of machine learning models for document classification, which required a robust ETL pipeline to preprocess and parse documents. The pipeline was initially designed for a single model, but the client wanted to expand it to support multiple models. The client also requested a CI/CD process to ensure the pipeline was tested and deployed in a controlled manner.',

            'Led a team of 2 data engineers, collaborating with data scientists to create an optimized end-to-end ETL pipeline for machine learning models.',
            'Spearheaded generalizing the pipeline to support multiple models, creating common phases for preprocessing and parsing documents, which reduced the time to production by 50%.',
