Welcome dear readers...

Im Vibhavari Bellutagi, from India, currently staying in France. I'm a Data Engineer and I got sometime to channelise my thoughts and experiences in the form of blog. I'm a big fan of `Learn by Doing`, so you will see most of the posts are practical oriented.

<!-- truncate -->

I always wanted to have a blog to share my thoughts and experiences with the data engineering world. Im beginner in the world of blogging, so Im still learning how to write a good and effective content. I hope you enjoy my blog and find it useful.

I have three different sections in my website:

1. [Blogs](index.md): Where I would long format technical blogs that I have experienced or learned recently.
2. [Tech Bytes](/TechBytes/intro): Where I would post small technical tips and tricks that I have learned.

Hope I will be able to keep up with the content and make it useful for you, im striving to make it better everyday.

Thanks for visiting my blog. Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to reach out to me on 
<SocialLinks />.

Cheers,
Vibhavari
